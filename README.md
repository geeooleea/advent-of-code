# Greetings! 🎄

Welcome to my attempt of teaching myself to code in Rust, by solving the challenges of [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/).

To run, have your inputs in a folder as

```
inputs
|-- day1.txt
|-- day2.txt
| ...
|-- day12.txt
```
then
```bash
cargo run --release <day.part>
```

> [!CAUTION]
> This is the product of challenging myself with something new (Rust) in a very hand-on manner, so it likely contains a bunch of ugly workarounds and anti-patterns 😅
